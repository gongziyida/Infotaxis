# Infotaxis
This is an implementation of infotaxis based on the paper [*‘Infotaxis’ as a strategy for searching without gradients*](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature05464) by Vergassola M, Villermaux E and Shraiman BI. A detailed introduction to infotaxis as a searching strategy is presented in the paper and its supported information.

This implementation includes 2D and 3D versions of infotaxis, allows wind to blow in an aribitrary direction, and enables the searcher to move in eight directions instead of four.
